# No secrets. 

<h3>You gotta have Python, pip, WMI and pyNVML installed in your machine.</h3>

<p>For Python - <a>https://www.python.org/downloads/</a> or go to Microsoft Store (it comes with <b>pip</b>)</p>
<p>For WMI - <code>pip install wmi</code></p>
<p>For pyNVML - <code>pip install nvidia-ml-py</code></p>

<p>This only works on Windows OS and NVIDA GPUS, adaptations to Linux and RADEON Graphics may come later, if a single soul ask for it.</p>
